# RFM Customer Segmentation (End-to-End)

A production-style, end-to-end **RFM (Recencyâ€“Frequencyâ€“Monetary) customer segmentation** project featuring:
- Quantile-based RFM scoring and interpretable segment labels (VIP, Loyal, Big Spenders, At Risk, etc.).
- Clean EDA and data preparation.
- **Machine learning classifiers** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM) with **ROC/AUC** comparison.
- **Interactive Plotly dashboard** with KPI cards, segment distribution, RÃ—F heatmap, and recencyâ€“frequency scatter.
- Reproducible environment via `requirements.txt`.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

```bash

# create environment (optional) and install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the notebook
jupyter notebook rfm_analysis_projectORIGNAL.ipynb
```

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- **RFM Scoring**: quantile-based R, F, M scores with deterministic, explainable segment labels.
- **Interactive Visuals**: KPI cards, Segment treemap/bar, RÃ—F heatmap, scatter sized by Monetary.
- **Modeling**: multiple classifiers evaluated with **ROC/AUC** and confusion matrix.
- **Clean Code**: modular, reproducible, and portfolio-ready.
